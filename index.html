      <h2> History </h2>

      <p> Northeastern University is committed to inventing and demonstrating cutting-edge sustainability solutions, starting with our own campus and community. This website details our efforts on campus, our plans, and climate leadership. </p>

      <img  src="image/Yearly Percent Change SqFt vs Emissions Over Time.png" alt="" style="width:300%">
      <div class="image_captions"><i>SqFt vs Emissions</i></div>
      <p>From this graph, we can observe how year over year since 2005, Northeastern’s campus has only grown in percentage of square footage. In contrast, we can see that year over year, Northeastern’s emissions have decreased more than they’ve increased in percentage. Typically, you would expect a campus to increase emissions as the amount of land and buildings increases. Explanations for this include the replacement of natural gas over oil and newer or more renovated buildings that work more efficiently.</p>
      

      <img src="image/Food Waste history by Location.png" alt="Parhasard Image 2" style="width:300%">
      <div class="image_captions"><i>Food Service History</i></div>
      <p>Looking at Northeastern’s food waste distribution, it answers a lot of expected questions, and it creates some new ones. As we would expect, the IV loading dock and Stetson West Loading Dock (both dining halls) yield the highest distribution of food waste as both of their middle 50% indicators rise above most outliers of other areas. The large range of outliers at Speare may stem from different events. Surprisingly, Curry, while third, follows a fair bit behind in food waste from IV and Stetson West.</p>

      <div class="image_captions"><i>Building CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions per SqFt/Yr</i></div>
      <p>Are we currently meeting the BERDO2030 requirements? Where does Northeastern stand in terms of building CO2 emissions? The legend provides a guide for readers to draw a relationship between the current kgCO2/SqFt/yr emissions by building level and the BERDO2030 progress bars.

         Based on this data, the building with the highest CO2 emissions is noted as ‘Egan Engineering Science Research Center’. Upon further calculations, roughly 27% of the buildings currently meet the requirements.</p>

      <img src="image/NU Energy Consumption Over time line plot 1.png" alt="Parhasard Image 2" style="width:300%">
      <div class="image_captions"><i>Consumption Per Energy Source</i>.</div>
      <p>This visualization illustrates the trending of Northeastern University’s energy sources over the last 16 years, as measured in mmBTUs (Metric Million British Thermal Unit,). 

         Oil use has been trending down significantly, while electricity usage has been trending up, taking a marked jump in 2014. This a good thing, as the University has taken great strides in electrifying campus buildings. Surprisingly, while natural gas use has risen, it is not by much. After 2015, there seems to be some relationship between gas and electricity sources, as they rise and fall in similar amounts. 
         
         If we are to meet the City of Boston’s BERDO ordinance, natural gas would need to trend down while electricity usage continues to rise.

      <div class="image_captions"><i>Campus GHG Emissions</i></div>
      <p>Annually released emissions of carbon dioxide equivalents (MTCDE) measured in kilograms and metric tons per category. This is based on main campus emissions, which do not account for emissions on other Northeastern campuses outside of Massachusetts.

         Emitted CH4(kg) and N2O(kg) is proportionately less than emitted CO2(kg) on campus. This points our attention to the source - which buildings and the GHG emission intensity by building on campus (MA). </p>

      <div class="image_captions"><i>Yearly Waste Dispostion</i></div>
      <p>Disposed consistently holds the majority percentage from 2019, indicating that more than half of waste is not recycled, composted, or donated/sold. While on the other hand, the combination of composing and recycling is consistently growing across the years despite the dip in the single recycling category, indicating a growing efforts in these categories. However, waste that were diverted to donation/sale are still extremely low compared to the three other major categories, which could indicate a lack of infrastructure or policy to support this waste management pathway.</p>

      <img src="image/" alt="Parhasard Image 2">
      <div class="image_captions"><i>Waste Type by Year</i></div>
      <p>This plot shows the disposition of waste materials at Northeastern university over the past 4 years, broken down by the material types. We can see that proportionally, Trash disposal has continued to be the leading  overall disposition method.  
         Composting has taken a marked jump forward. After taking a dip in 2020, it has grown as a disposition method in both 2021 and 2022. Other/Mixed Recycling has grown the most within the Recycling category.</p>

      <div class="image_captions"><i>NU Waste and Recycling Method Over Time</i></div>
      <p>This plot shows the disposition of waste materials at Northeastern university over the past 4 years. Each point represents a waste material type (waste, cardboard, compost, textile, etc.).  
         I was surprised to fin that although waste/trash disposition initially decreased in 2020, it has been trending upwards over the past few years. Similarly, recycling and composting  both took a significant dip in 2020 (recycling more than composting), and have been slowly edging back up, but are still yet to overtake the waste/trash as the highest disposition method. 
         I believe it is likely that these two more sustainable disposition methods have seen growth due to various initiatives that the Northeastern’s Climate Justice & Sustainability Hub has put in place, like composting programs at the dining areas and dorms and increased community awareness.</p>
