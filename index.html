      <h2> History </h2>

      <p> Northeastern University is committed to inventing and demonstrating cutting-edge sustainability solutions, starting with our own campus and community. This website details our efforts on campus, our plans, and climate leadership. </p>

      <p> Prospective applicants to the Academy must prepare a demo CD of their work, be it original productions, songs or a DJ set, along with a completed questionnaire, and mail it to a Red Bull Music Academy office in Cologne, Germany. From there, each application is taken into consideration, with no quota on country or musical genre. From these applications, 60 are selected and broken down into two groups of 30.<sup>[7]</sup> Each group of 30 is flown in to the location of the respective year's event for one of two fortnightly “terms” In 2012, the Academy received over 4000 applications to take part in the 2013 New York City edition.<sup>[8]</sup></p>

      <p>For two weeks, the participants have the to opportunity work in up to twelve studios specially designed<sup>[9]</sup> for every edition of the Red Bull Music Academy. There, they have access to a range of the latest gear as well as analog equipment for music production and performance.<sup>[10]</sup> There are no deadlines or set quotas, and Red Bull does not own the music produced in the building.<sup>[11]</sup> These collaborative sessions are in part facilitated by the Academy’s “Studio Team,” all experienced music producers in various fields. Twice daily, participants attend lectures by guest speakers who range from composers, producers,<sup>[12]</sup> sound engineers and technological pioneers, to rappers<sup>[13]</sup> and industry professionals. Lecture attendance is the only compulsory part of the program.</p>

      <p> The Red Bull Music Academy does not seek to select or create “stars,” <sup>[15]</sup> instead bringing together music makers with a wide range of talents, skill levels and cultural backgrounds. Notable former participants include Aloe Blacc, Branko of Buraka Som Sistema, Bahrainian oud player Hasan Hujairi, Juan Son, Natalia Lafourcade, Nina Kraviz, David Eriksson of Teenage Engineering, Blackcoffee, Flying Lotus, Salva and Andreya Triana.</p>

      <p> The Academy also publishes a yearly double-CD compilation of music produced at the respective last edition entitled <i>Various Assets&thinsp;—&thinsp;Not For Sale</i>. Since 2004, those compilations have featured original music from more than 300 artists, including Dorian Concept, Flying Lotus, Lusine, Theo Parrish, Aloe Blacc, Mark Pritchard, XXXchange, Om’Mas Keith of Sa-Ra, Illuminated faces, Tony Allen, Mr Hudson, Dennis Coffey, Hudson Mohawke, DJ Zinc, Wally Badarou, Benga, Phonte, Jake One, Steve Spacek of Spacek, and Natalia Lafourcade. </p>

      <p> The Red Bull Music Academy hosts additional workshops and three-day Base Camp sessions in more than 60 countries every year. These events resemble the actual Academy in consisting of music lectures, hands-on production workshops, studio sessions, art exhibitions, and night time activities such as concerts and club events.<sup>[16]</sup> There is a strong focus on local topics as well as an international perspective.</p>

      <img src="image/Yearly Percent Change SqFt vs Emissions Over Time.png" alt="Parhasard Image 2">
      <div class="image_captions"><i>SqFt vs Emissions</i></div>
      <p>From this graph, we can observe how year over year since 2005, Northeastern’s campus has only grown in percentage of square footage. In contrast, we can see that year over year, Northeastern’s emissions have decreased more than they’ve increased in percentage. Typically, you would expect a campus to increase emissions as the amount of land and buildings increases. Explanations for this include the replacement of natural gas over oil and newer or more renovated buildings that work more efficiently.</p>

      <img src="image/Food Waste history by Location.png" alt="Parhasard Image 2">
      <div class="image_captions"><i>Food Service History</i></div>
      <p>Looking at Northeastern’s food waste distribution, it answers a lot of expected questions, and it creates some new ones. As we would expect, the IV loading dock and Stetson West Loading Dock (both dining halls) yield the highest distribution of food waste as both of their middle 50% indicators rise above most outliers of other areas. The large range of outliers at Speare may stem from different events. Surprisingly, Curry, while third, follows a fair bit behind in food waste from IV and Stetson West.</p>

      <div class="image_captions"><i>Building CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions per SqFt/Yr</i></div>
      <p>Are we currently meeting the BERDO2030 requirements? Where does Northeastern stand in terms of building CO2 emissions? The legend provides a guide for readers to draw a relationship between the current kgCO2/SqFt/yr emissions by building level and the BERDO2030 progress bars.

         Based on this data, the building with the highest CO2 emissions is noted as ‘Egan Engineering Science Research Center’. Upon further calculations, roughly 27% of the buildings currently meet the requirements.</p>

      <div class="image_captions"><i>Consumption Per Energy Source</i>, Par Hasard, RedBull Music Academy Montreal, 2016.</div>
      <p>This visualization illustrates the trending of Northeastern University’s energy sources over the last 16 years, as measured in mmBTUs (Metric Million British Thermal Unit,). 

         Oil use has been trending down significantly, while electricity usage has been trending up, taking a marked jump in 2014. This a good thing, as the University has taken great strides in electrifying campus buildings. Surprisingly, while natural gas use has risen, it is not by much. After 2015, there seems to be some relationship between gas and electricity sources, as they rise and fall in similar amounts. 
         
         If we are to meet the City of Boston’s BERDO ordinance, natural gas would need to trend down while electricity usage continues to rise.

      <div class="image_captions"><i>Campus GHG Emissions</i>, Par Hasard, RedBull Music Academy Montreal, 2016.</div>
      <p>Annually released emissions of carbon dioxide equivalents (MTCDE) measured in kilograms and metric tons per category. This is based on main campus emissions, which do not account for emissions on other Northeastern campuses outside of Massachusetts.

         Emitted CH4(kg) and N2O(kg) is proportionately less than emitted CO2(kg) on campus. This points our attention to the source - which buildings and the GHG emission intensity by building on campus (MA). </p>

         <h1>NU FOOD\WASTE DATA</h1>
      <img src="image/" alt="Parhasard Image 2">
      <div class="image_captions"><i>Yearly Waste Dispostion</i></div>
      <p>Disposed consistently holds the majority percentage from 2019, indicating that more than half of waste is not recycled, composted, or donated/sold. While on the other hand, the combination of composing and recycling is consistently growing across the years despite the dip in the single recycling category, indicating a growing efforts in these categories. However, waste that were diverted to donation/sale are still extremely low compared to the three other major categories, which could indicate a lack of infrastructure or policy to support this waste management pathway.</p>

      <img src="image/" alt="Parhasard Image 2">
      <div class="image_captions"><i>Waste Type by Year</i></div>
      <p>This plot shows the disposition of waste materials at Northeastern university over the past 4 years, broken down by the material types. We can see that proportionally, Trash disposal has continued to be the leading  overall disposition method.  
         Composting has taken a marked jump forward. After taking a dip in 2020, it has grown as a disposition method in both 2021 and 2022. Other/Mixed Recycling has grown the most within the Recycling category.</p>

      <div class="image_captions"><i>NU Waste and Recycling Method Over Time</i></div>
      <p>This plot shows the disposition of waste materials at Northeastern university over the past 4 years. Each point represents a waste material type (waste, cardboard, compost, textile, etc.).  
         I was surprised to fin that although waste/trash disposition initially decreased in 2020, it has been trending upwards over the past few years. Similarly, recycling and composting  both took a significant dip in 2020 (recycling more than composting), and have been slowly edging back up, but are still yet to overtake the waste/trash as the highest disposition method. 
         I believe it is likely that these two more sustainable disposition methods have seen growth due to various initiatives that the Northeastern’s Climate Justice & Sustainability Hub has put in place, like composting programs at the dining areas and dorms and increased community awareness.</p>
