    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p class="intro-text">
        [This website focuses on showcasing Northeastern University's (NU) efforts and progression in sustainability, aiming to bring to light its environmental achievements and aspirations in an accessible and comprehensive manner. The core objective is to highlight NU’s sustainability milestones, while also providing a clear picture of its adherence to established sustainability goals.
It aims to be a cornerstone of information and inspiration, reinforcing our dedication to sustainability, and fostering a culture of environmental responsibility and engagement.

We investigate pivotal questions regarding the university’s sustainability trajectory and the performance efficacy of its buildings in terms of energy use and waste management. Utilizing data from various sustainability metrics, such as energy consumption, food waste, recycling, and general waste management, we aim to provide a clear and comprehensive view of NU's sustainability practices and identify areas that might benefit from additional focus and intervention. 

The intended audience spans from internal stakeholders, such as students and faculty, to the broader community, encompassing local residents, businesses, and potentially extending to a regional audience in New England. The visualization of data is crafted to be intuitive and informative, offering a clear view of NU's sustainability practices and providing a platform that informs, engages, and potentially inspires enhanced sustainability practices within and beyond the NU community.]

    <p class="figure-description">From this graph, we can observe how year over year since 2005, Northeastern’s campus has only grown in percentage of square footage. In contrast, we can see that year over year, Northeastern’s emissions have decreased more than they’ve increased in percentage.</p>
    <p class="insights-text">Typically, you would expect a campus to increase emissions as the amount of land and buildings increases. Explanations for this include the replacement of natural gas over oil and newer or more renovated buildings that work more efficiently.</p>
